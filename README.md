# homePIX
Python-based photo-sharing site. Demo online at https://elliottcb.pythonanywhere.com/

## Introduction
This is a photo-sharing site based on Python Django. It is intended to become a shared resource for stock and other photographers to pool their resources and hopefully regain control from large stock agencies.
 
## Purpose
 
## How to use
The project is currently quite a long way from simply downloading and hitting "go". The operations needed to run your own copy include the following:

* Installing Python and Python Django on a server. (I use pythonanywhere.com)
* Pointing the code to your own picture stash (I currently use SmugMug)
* Setting up public/private key access with your own keys
* Importing your data, including pictures, keywords and EXIF data, into your database

Later it will be possible to 

* Download a Docker image containing a bare-bones copy of homePIX
* Deploy to a cloud service such as Kubernetes

I would obviously be very interested to hear from anyone who tries to use the project and to know about what obstacles you have encountered. The faster I find out how to make it easier. the faster the project can grow and become useful.
